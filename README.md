## My programming mantra

> "The best programs are written so that computing machines can perform them quickly, and human beings can understand them clearly."
> *Donald Knuth*

A great programmer is like an essayist, blending aesthetics, structure, and logic. Knuth reminds us that coding isnâ€™t just about getting to the solutionâ€”itâ€™s about crafting code that communicates, convinces, and endures.
